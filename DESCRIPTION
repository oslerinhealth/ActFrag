Description: Recent studies haven shown that, on top of total daily
        active/sedentary volumes, the time accumulation strategies
        provide more sensitive information. This package provides
        functions to extract commonly used fragmentation metrics to
        quantify such time accumulation strategies based on minute
        level actigraphy-measured activity counts data.
